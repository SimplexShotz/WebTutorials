      <h1>Help Page</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the help page! If you don't understand something or have found an issue with the site, please report it to me at <a class="blue" href="mailto:brancy280@gmail.com">brancy280@gmail.com</a>.</p>
      <p>If you need help navigating the website, then see the following information.</p>
      <h1>Using the Navbar</h1>
      <p>The navbar (navigation bar) is a powerful tool. Using it, you can journey across the enitrety of the website. To get to the home page to access the tutorials, press "Home." If you ever need to get back here, press "Help." The "About" page will give you some important information about me and this website's contents.</p>
      <h1>Using Tutorials</h1>
      <p>Tutorials will take you step-by-step through learning a new concept. If something doesn't make sense, tell me at <a class="blue" href="mailto:brancy280@gmail.com">brancy280@gmail.com</a>. The large, <b>bold</b> letters explain what the section is about. The smaller text will guide you through the lesson.</p>
      <p>If you see any text inside of a black box with an orange rectangle at the bottom, then you know that the text inside is actually code. This code can be copied and pasted into an HTML, CSS or JavaScript file (whichever is indicated), where it can then be saved an run.</p>
      <h1>Creating an HTML File</h1>
      <p>Creating a new file is a breeze! Simply open up your computer's search menu (the Windows icon on Windows, and the search icon in the top right on Mac), and type in "Notepad" (on Windows) or "TextEdit" (on Mac). Open up the first result, and get to typing!</p>
      <p>To save the file, press "ctrl" (or "command" on a Mac) and "s" together. This will bring up a menu where you can name your file. <b>Make sure that the file name ends in ".html"</b>! Once it's named, hit "Save." You can then open the file from where you saved it to see your work.</p>
